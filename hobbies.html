            <p>so, my hobbies are actually a lot. from the beginning I like swimming because it's cool when mastering the techniques. the second is shooting, honestly I like it when I hold the gun and load the bullets. the third is actually not a hobby just like to see the sea view / go to the beach not because it's cool, besides cool enjoying the view in the afternoon on the beach.</p>
